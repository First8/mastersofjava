1 Introduction

  I have fond memories of AlphabetSoup or 'letter vermicelli' as we call it in Dutch. With
  each plate of soup it was a challenge to see if you could make certain words with it. The
  longer the better!  

2 Assignment

  Implement the canMakeWord(String soup,String word) method in such a way that it will return 
  true if the given word can be made out of the available letters in the soup. Keep in mind
  that each letter in the soup can only be used once. 

3 Example

  The soup contains the following letters: AADEJKOSUW
  The word to be checked is: WODKASJU
  
  Soup    Word    All the letters in the word are available   
  A  2    1  A    in the soup, so the word can be made.
  D  1    1  D    
  E  1    0  E
  J  1    1  J
  K  1    1  K
  O  1    1  O
  S  1    1  S
  U  1    1  U
  W  1    1  W
  
4 Hints & Tips

  - The example above may be very educational, but its implementation takes a bit of effort.
  - There might be a more efficient solution, time wise.
  - Beware of strange characters.

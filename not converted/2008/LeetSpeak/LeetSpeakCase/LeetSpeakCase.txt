1 Introduction

  Recently a tool was published on the Internet to copy OVCHIP cards or actually any card which uses the
  MIFARE chip. The bureaucrats are frightened that this could ruin their carefully crafted plans to monitor
  and control the population. They decided to investigate this tool but found out that the documentation was
  written in something called Leet which is quite incomprehensible for mere mortals.

  Leet or Eleet (sometimes rendered l33t, 1337, or 31337) is also known as Leetspeak. It is an alphabet which 
  is used primarily on the Internet and uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters.
  
  And guess what, they have asked you to write a tool that translates Leet into something more readable. 

2 Assignment

  Implement the translate(..) method so that it translates Leet to plain English. 
  You must apply the following rules:
  - 0 can be used for O 
  - 1 can be used for I  
  - 2 can be used for Z  
  - 3 can be used for E 
  - 4 can be used for A 
  - X0R at the end of a word can be used for ER
  - T3H can be used as the word THE
  - & at the end of a word can be used for AND
  - X can be used for CK 

3 Example

  The Leet word 'H4XX0R' translates to HACKER using the following substitutions:
  H->H  (no change). 
  4->A  
  X->CK 
  XOR->ER  

4 Hints & Tips

  - You can do a lot with simple substitution.
  - But some substitutions are more equal than others.
  - A 0 looks a lot like an O. You have been warned!

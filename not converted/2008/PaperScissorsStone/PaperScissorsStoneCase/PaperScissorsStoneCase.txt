1 Introduction

  The rise of the casual gamer has surged the sales of easy to play computer games. And with
  a gross revenue of 2.25 billion dollar last year world wide (and growing 20% per year) your 
  company decides to take a piece of the action. 
  
  An easy computer game means returning to the basics. And you cannot get more basic than with
  the classic 'Paper Scissors Stone' which forms the basis of many strategy games. 
  
  The money is almost in the bank, we only need to find a programmer that makes the game.. 

2 Assignment

  implements the rules of the paper scissors stone game. The rules are:

  If two equal opponents battle each other the outcome is a TIE.

1 Introduction

  Something went terribly wrong during the printing of the Ballot Cards for the Presidential Election.
  Due to a loose sensor all the cards came out with the wrong dimensions. Some are too large while 
  others are too small, causing the checkboxes for voting either Obama or McCain to be placed at 
  irregular positions across the paper. This makes it impossible to count the votes using standard
  equipment. Reprinting is also out of the question, the only one to save the day is you!   

2 Assignment

  Implement the Ballot Card analyser which must determine if the ballot card presented is
  either a vote for Obama or McCain, a blank ballot form or an invalid one.  
  A valid ballot card contains the following:
  - one copy of the names of the candidates together with an checkbox: [ ]
    The checkboxes consist of exactly 3 characters: '[',' ' and ']'.        
  - only one checkbox may be checked with a character other than whitespace, e.g. [X]
  - The marked checkbox identifies a vote for that candidate.

3 Example

  The following ballot card is valid and contains a vote for Obama:  
   __________________________ 
  |                          |
  |     Obama [X]            |
  | McCain [ ]               |
  |__________________________|
  
  The following ballot card is invalid:
   __________________________ 
  |        McCain [ ]        |
  |     Obama [ ]            |
  | McCain [X]               |
  |Obama [ ]                 |
  |__________________________|  
  
4 Hints & Tips

  - The String class has a bunch of methods that may come in useful.
  - If that does not work you can always try something with regular expressions.  
  - You never know the character of a voter.

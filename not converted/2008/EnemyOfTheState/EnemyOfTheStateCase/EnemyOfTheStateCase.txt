1 Introduction

  Our action hero Smill With is on the run again from the Government. And again he is
  wholly innocent. Unfortunately the Government does not believe him until he has shown
  them 3 pieces of evidence which can only be found by searching at evidence locations.
  To make things worse, the Government has specified a series of fixed rules and 
  regulations by which he has to Run away, Hide and find the evidence. To help Mr With
  in his quest he has accidently acquired an independent security specialist, you.

  The following state transition diagram represents how a proper Fugitive behaves: 
                     ___              ____
            pursuit /   \ RUN        /    \ SEARCH,USE 
                    |   |            |    |
  +-------+ found +-------+ found +---------+ isInnocent +--------+
  |UNAWARE|------>|RUNNING|<------|SEARCHING|----------->|INNOCENT| 
  +-------+       +-------+       +---------+            +--------+
                    |    \ \           ^ GOTO __________/
           captured |     \ \HIDE      |     /isInnocent
            +--------+     \ \--->+---------+
            |CAPTURED|      \     | HIDING  |
            +--------+ found \<---+---------+ 
   
   * At first the Fugitive is UNAWARE of the Government searching for him.
   * When the Government has found the Fugitive he is RUNNING for his life.
     When RUNNING, the Fugitive can either RUN or HIDE. HIDE is only allowed if
     the distance between him and the Government agents is >=3. 
   * When the Fugitive is HIDING, he can be found again by the government, he 
     can GOTO an Evidence Location or if he has evidence he can USE this evidence
     to prove that he is innocent.
   * When the Fugitive is SEARCHING at an Evidence Location he can either SEARCH
     for more evidence, USE any existing evidence or be found again by the 
     Government.
   * When the Fugitive has acquired 3 pieces of evidence he is declared INNOCENT
     by the Government.
   * If the distance between the Government agents and the Fugitive becomes zero
     the Fugitive is captured.  
   
   Your assignment is to properly implement the Fugitive class so that he behaves
   according to these rules.

4 Hints & Tips

  - There are more ways to implement this assignment.
  - You could just hack some code in the appropriate methods.
  - Or use the provided State class with useful transitions and actions.   
  - If you can't seem to pass the distance, you may need to store this.

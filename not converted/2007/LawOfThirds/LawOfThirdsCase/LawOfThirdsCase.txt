1 Introduction

  The unimaginable has happened. Your company has gone bust. And why ? Too many
  bench sitters. You vow that this will never happen again. To be sure you will
  apply the so called Law of Thirds to each company you will get a job interview
  with.
  
  The Law of Thirds states that the cash flow generated by a fully assigned 
  employee can be divided into 3 equal parts :
  - Salary.
  - Overhead.
  - Profit.
  
  The Law of Thirds therefore can be used to estimate your salary based on 
  the hours you've worked and your wage. But it can also be used to estimate
  the profitability of a company (assuming the salaries don't vary too greatly)
  by matching the generated profit by the assigned employees to the costs of
  the bench sitters.

2 Assignment

  Implement the LawOfThirdsCompany class so that you can estimate which company
  you should work for. You need to implement the getEstimatedSalary(..) method
  to get an indication of the salary you need to ask for. Also you need to
  implement the isMakingProfit(..) method to see if the company actually is
  making profit.    

3 Examples

  Your are working 40 hours a week for a wage of 80.0 euro's. Your monthly 
  salary should be 40 hours * 4 weeks * 80 euro's * 1/3 = 4266 and a bit euro's.
  
  The company has 42 people on the payroll and 32 of them are full time assigned.
  Is the company profitable ? : 32 * 1/3 > (42-32) * 2/3 : Yes. 

4 Hints & Tips

  - The Law of Thirds is really useful, some people can even do the calculations by head :)
  - The unit tests expect accuracy to the 2nd digit.

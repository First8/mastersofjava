1 Introduction

  Sometimes the beginning is the end and the end is the beginning. For example in the
  motion picture 'Los Amantes del Circulo Polar' (Eng: The Lovers of the Arctic Circle)
  both of the main characters have names that are palindromes: 'Otto' and 'Ana'. A 
  palindrome is a word (or dataset) that can be read identically from left to right 
  and from right to left. In this assignment we'll make a method that will identify
  datasets that are Palindromes in the hope that it will aid us in finding a good
  movie.

2 Assignment

  Implement the method 'isPalindrome' which must return true if the content of the
  given collection is a Palindrome. For this assignment a dataset is a palindrome when
  all elements have the following statement as true : 
  
  data[x].equals(data[data.length-x-1])
  
  Where 'data' is an array containing the dataset and 'x' is its index.
   
  Note: NULL and Empty datasets are not considered palindromes.
  You may assume that there are no NULL values in the datasets.

3 Example

               0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
  char[] c= { 'a','b','r','a','c','a','d','a','r','b','a' };
  
  c[0] == c[10]
  c[1] == c[9]
  c[2] == c[8]
  c[3] == c[7]
  c[4] != c[6] -> The data set is NOT a Palindrome.
  
              0  1  2  3  4 
  int[] i = { 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 };
  
  i[0] == i[4]
  i[1] == i[3]
  i[2] == i[2] -> The data set is a Palindrome.
                            

4 Hints & Tips

  - A Deque is an interesting variant of the Queue.
  - It allows for adding, retrieving and removing objects at the beginning and the end.
  - Just like a palindrome :-)

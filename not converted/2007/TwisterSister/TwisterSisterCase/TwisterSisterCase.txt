1 Introduction

  Your little sister loves to dance with your big sister. They want to be cheerleaders
  or something. Anyway, they made a whole dance routine and now they are practicing.
  Your big sister is quite good at dancing, but your little sister needs a little help
  from you, her [brother/sister].

2 Assignment

  Implement TwisterSisterImpl's dance(..) method. It contains the knowledge on how 
  to transform the steps from the dance routine into body movement. The parameters
  given are a collection of moves and your little sister needs to be told where to 
  move to.
  
  There are 6 different moves your sister(s) can make:
  - Move.STEP_LEFT : move one step to the left.
  - Move.STEP_RIGHT : move one step to the right.
  - Move.TURN_LEFT : turn 90 degrees counter clockwise.
  - Move.TURN_RIGHT : turn 90 degrees clockwise.   
  - Move.SMALLER : Tells your sister to make smaller steps (50% of current).
  - Move.BIGGER  : Tells your sister to make bigger steps (200% of current).

  You may assume your little sister starts at position (0,0) and is facing
  the top of the screen. The step size is 1.0.

3 Examples

  Given the following dance routine: STEP_LEFT,TURN_RIGHT,STEP_LEFT
  your little sister moves in the following way:
  
  Start        Move            Result  
   0.0, 0.0 -> STEP_LEFT    -> -1.0, 0.0
  -1.0, 0.0 -> TURN_RIGHT   -> -1.0, 0.0  (now facing the right side o.t. screen)
  -1.0, 0.0 -> STEP_LEFT    -> -1.0, 1.0  left is now up !   

  Given the following dance routine: STEP_LEFT,SMALLER,STEP_RIGHT,BIGGER,STEP_LEFT
  your little sister moves in the following way:
  
  Start        Move            Result  
   0.0, 0.0 -> STEP_LEFT   -> -1.0, 0.0
  -1.0, 0.0 -> SMALLER     -> -1.0, 0.0  (step size is now 50% of 1 = 0.5)
  -1.0, 0.0 -> STEP_RIGHT  -> -0.5, 0.0     
  -0.5, 0.0 -> BIGGER      -> -0.5, 0.0  (step size is now 200% of 0.5 = 1)
  -0.5, 0.0 -> STEP_RIGHT  ->  0.5, 0.0

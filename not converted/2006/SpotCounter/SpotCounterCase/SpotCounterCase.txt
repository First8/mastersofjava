1 Introduction

  Zun Microdevices has unleashed its Sneaky Peeky Object Transducers (SPOTs) upon the world. 
  No object is safe anymore. The SPOTs are monitoring all state and communications. 
  Massive identity theft is occuring because of this and even voting computers are not safe 
  anymore.
  
  Somebody has to spot eh Stop this !
  
  Fortunately you have built a hardware scanner to find those nasty SPOTs - the only thing you need 
  is a good algorithm to identify and count them.

2 Assignment

  Implement the method scan(Radar r) to return the number of SPOTs the Radar has found. Unfortunately the
  Radar only returns hits and some hits may be SPOTs but others are not. Fortunately the Hits themself can
  differentiate between a SPOT hit and something else, you need only to ask them.

3 Example

  The Radar returns 3 hits. 
  The first hit is not a SPOT.
  The second hit is a SPOT !
  The third hit is not a SPOT.
  The result is : 1 SPOT.

4 Hits

  - look at the Hit and Radar source code. This will tell you which methods you can invoke.
  - you need to iterate over the hits. In Java there are several ways to do this. The for statement is one of them.
  - only count the hits that return true on the isSpot() method call.

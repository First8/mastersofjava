1 Introduction

  NASA will soon launch a deep space probe. If it will encounter an alien lifeform the probe must
  send a personalised greeting to the alien. Everybody knows that aliens like to be treated humanly.
  This advanced piece of technology will be coded by nobody else but you, our star(ting) programmer. 

2 Assigment

  Implement the method sayIt(String name) in such a way that it will return a formal earthly greeting
  in to form of 'Hello' and then the name. If the name is not given, simply state 'Hello' without the
  name.

3 Example

  Given the name 'Zaphod' return the String 'Hello Zaphod'
  Given the name 'Gargravarr' return the String 'Hello Gargravarr'
  Given no name return the String 'Hello' 

4 Hints

  - The quotes in the assignment and testcases are just for readability.
  - You can add strings together.
  - If the string is null return "Hello"

1 Introduction

Duke builded a template builder what was working, he thought ;<).
In the template a place was reserved for the dukemail address. As the 
template builder was used several documents failed to parse due to 
a invalid dukemail address.

2 Assignment

Help Duke out and implement the dukemail address validator. The validator should
return a true or false depending on the validity of the string passed.


A valid dukemail address follows almost the same rules as regular email, only simpler:

The local-part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters:
- Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters 
- Digits 0 to 9
- Character . (dot) provided that:
	- It is not the first or last character
	- It does not appear consecutively 
	- It does not end the local part

The domain-part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters:
- Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters
- Digits 0 to 9
- Character . (dot) provided that:
	- It is used only once
Also the domain part must end with .dukemail

3 Example
Valid examples are:
John.Doe.ha@example.dukemail
John34.Doe@example123.dukemail
John.Doe.ha@eXample123.dukemail

Invalid examples are:
John..Doe@example.dukemail
JohnDoe.@example.dukemail
John34.Doe@.example123.dukemail
John.Doe.ha@eXample.123.dukemail


4 Hints & Tips

The local part is before the at-sign and the domain part is after the at-sign

For example:
john.scala@oracleofthesun.dukemail 

Local part is : john.scala
Domain part is : oracleofthesun.dukemail

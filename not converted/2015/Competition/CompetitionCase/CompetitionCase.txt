For the new RTL-show "Help, the president is a programmer", one is on site in Vianen with a mr. Janssen.
This mr. Janssen has, as an amateur programmer, build a program to keep score at the local badminton competition. 
This program, however, seems to contain some bugs which have yet to resolved. 
There is only half an hour left before the show has to be recorded and that's why you have been asked to solve these bugs. 
To check if everything has been solved, you can make use of old competitions. 
The application is correct if it passes all tests.

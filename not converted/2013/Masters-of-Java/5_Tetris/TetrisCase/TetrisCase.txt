1 Introduction

    Play one step in a game of Tetris.

2 Assignment

    Given a Tetris game and one block, determine the maximum number of rows that will collapse.

    A Game and a Block are the classes to begin with. Both have a width and a height.
    Both classes consist of Rows. Rows are made of Cells. Every cell has a Filling which can be empty or full.

3 Example

    Suppose a game:    And a block:    The best place to put the block:    That means that one row will collapse:
    
    |        |         YY              |  YY    |                          |        |
    |X  X X  |         Y               |X YX X  |                          |  XX    |
    |XX XXXXX|         Y               |XXYXXXXX|                          |X XX X  |
    |XX XXX X|                         |XX XXX X|                          |XX XXX X|
    +--------+                         +--------+                          +--------+

    The width of the game is 8, the height is 4.
    The width of the block is 2, the height is 3.

4 Hints & Tips

    Rows are ordered top-down, Cells are ordered left-to-right.
    
    game.getHeight() will give the number of rows of the game.
    game.getWidth() will give the number of columns of the game.
    game.getRow(0) will give the top row.
    game.getRow(0).getCell(0) will give the left cell of the top row.
    
    You can place a block in a game using game.placeBlock(colNr, rowNr).
    colNr and rowNr represent the top-left corner of the block.
    
    game.toString() can be used for visual feedback.

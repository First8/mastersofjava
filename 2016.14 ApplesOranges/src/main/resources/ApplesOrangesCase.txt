Apples and oranges

1. Introduction

  Apples and oranges cannot be compared, yet they can be counted.

  Because of 'reasons' only the local unix guru may or may not understand...

  In an unsorted mess of directories is a number of files with production
  numbers. Some of these files contain actual relevant data, with all kinds of
  details and a grant total.

  The file format is rather free, except for two rules:

  * Every relevant file contains a line as follows:
  total:2033. Where 2033 is variable, denoting the number of kilos produced.

  * As any guru has his habits, the relevant files have a name ending in .foo

  The reporting engine is written in java ( dismaying the unix guru).

2. Assignment

	The exercise is simple: given the Path, add up and report all the totals from
	relevant files.

	Of course, the unix guru says he can do this in one commandline action in under 30
	seconds of thought (and milliseconds of execution). So, doing this in 30
	minutes as Rockstar Enterprise Java Guru's should be trivial.

3. Hints

  * The given directory on the server will have subdirectories in which you can navigate. On each level there may be
    relevant files.

  * The class java.nio.File is your friend.

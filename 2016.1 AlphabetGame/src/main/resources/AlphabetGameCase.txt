1 Introduction

  I have fond memories of AlphabetGames or 'letter vermicelli' as we call it in Dutch. With
  each composition of letters it is a challenge to see if you could make certain words with it. The
  longer the better!  

2 Assignment

  Implement the canMakeWord(String letterComposition,String word) method in such a way that it will return 
  true if the given word can be made out of the available letters. Keep in mind
  that each letter in the composition can only be used once. 

3 Example

  The composition contains the following letters: AADEJKOSUW
  The word to be checked is: WODKASJU
  
Composition   Word    All the letters in the word are available   
  A  2        1  A    in the input composition, so the word can be made.
  D  1        1  D    
  E  1        0  E
  J  1        1  J
  K  1        1  K
  O  1        1  O
  S  1        1  S
  U  1        1  U
  W  1        1  W
  
4 Hints & Tips

  - The example above may be very educational, but its implementation takes a bit of effort.
  - There might be a more efficient solution, time wise.
  - Beware of strange characters.

The Recursive Ant Hill

1. Introduction 

  In the forest of the Veluwe rare ant species were seen. These ants have a remarkable way to build ant hills: they use complex mathematical recursion and induction! 
  The rows of the ant hill are conventionally enumerated starting with row n = 0 at the top (the 0th row). 
  The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.
  The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: 
  * In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. 
  * Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0. 
  * For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row.

2. Assignment
  * Produce a program that can make a such an Ant Hill

3. Example

  The Ant Hill has to look like the figure below after 9 generations.

4. Hints

  * Generations of ants can be calculated back. 
  * The value of numbers in a row is determined by numbers from the row above (as can be seen in the figure above).

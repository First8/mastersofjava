/**
 * Minor worker ants, or simply ‘workers’, are the most common ant found in any colony.

These sterile female ants are the smallest ant, but they do the most work.

Some look after the queen and brood, some forage for food from around the nest, whilst others maintain and expand the nest.

Workers can live between a few months and up to five years.

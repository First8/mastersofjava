1 Introduction

On the internet, Duke has found a couple of old programs for the 'doesnotexistanymore' CPU. 
Unfortunately, there are none of this type of CPU available anymore, let alone that 
they are operational.

Duke has figured out that the CPU on which this code is supposed to work had 8 functionally 
identical 8 bit registers and could control 16 output ports that also had a size of 8 bit. 
To do that, the CPU uses the following instructions:

  ld destRegister, value 
    value -> destRegister
    destRegister [0 - 7]
    value [0 - 255]
  
  mv destRegister, sourceRegister
    sourceRegister -> destRegister
    destRegister [0 - 7]
    sourceRegister [0 - 7]
  
  add destRegister, sourceRegister
    destRegister + sourceRegister -> destRegister

  out sourceRegister, port
    sourceRgister -> port
    sourceRegister [0-7]
    port [0-15]
  
  Duke has been busy for quite some time, trying to understand the programs, 
  but manually going through all machine instructions is an annoying job even for Duke.
  
  2 Assigment
  
  Help Duke understanding the programs by implementing 
  a virtual CPU which can execute the code.
  
  3 Example
  
  LD 0, 100
  results in register 0 getting the value 100.
  
  4 Hints & Tips
  
  * The command pattern can be useful
  * It is only an 8 bit CPU

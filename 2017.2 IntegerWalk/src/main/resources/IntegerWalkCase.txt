Pointy-haired Boss: Let's have our meeting while we take a walk. 
Dilbert: Absolutely. Shall I expect the usual? 
Pointy-haired Boss: The usual? 
Dilbert: The first five minutes will be nothing but you trying to find your phone. 
Then you'll need to return some calls "real quick," then send an email before we leave. 
On the way to the elevator we will be accosted by every employee you've been avoiding for a week. 
Then you'll invite one of them to walk with us, which means we can't talk about my project. 
But it doesn't matter because you'll be on your phone the entire walk anyway. 
Pointy-haired Boss: Did you know that walking lowers stress? 
Dilbert: Does it?!!

Dilbert starts at the point (0,0) on the Euclidean plane. 
He wants to get to the point (a,b), where a and b are nonnegative integers. 
The only kinds of steps he can take are to step one unit in either the positive x direction, or the positive y direction. 
In other words, he can go from (x,y) to either (x+1,y) or (x,y+1).

Dilbert is wondering how many ways there are for him to get to (a,b). 
But, all he wants your help for is to find whether that number is even or odd.

##Example

For example, if (a,b) = (2,1), then there are three paths Dilbert can take:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1)
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1)
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1)
Since three is odd, you should return True.

##Input/Output

Input 1 (a) : integer
0 <= a <= 100

Input 2 (b) : integer
0 <= b <= 100

Output : boolean
True if the number of paths is odd, False if it's even.

1 Introduction

  Your local hospital wants to fully automate the
  resume to skills matching process. Currently this is done by hand which is
  both too slow and error prone (they use trained monkeys to do the selection).
  
  For this you selected an Software Architect to devise up some nice framework to
  make an skill expert system. Unfortunately the Architect had something more
  profitable to do and left, so now you're left a partial framework and the
  Architects assurance: 'You have only to implement the factory, the rest
  is peanuts'.  

2 Assignment

  Implement the DoctorHunterImpl class so that it correctly constructs the
  SkillExpert components and correctly matches the resumes to skill criteria.   
  
  The factory defines three different types of SkillExpert components which all 
  can be implemented using inner or anonymous classes. 
  
  The three components are :
  - Match : matches a single skill and experience level to a resume.
  - And : matches if all its child skill experts also match.
  - Or : matches if one of its child skill experts match.

3 Example

  You have two resumes:
  dr Bob  which is a Physiotherapy,GURU and a Surgery,EXPERT
  dr Phil which is a Physiotherapy,GURU and a Psychology,GURU
  
  Your client is looking for a (Physiotherapy,GURU)&((Surgery,EXPERT)|(Psychology,GURU))
  (the '&' means AND and the '|' means OR)  

  Using the factory the following SkillExpert tree will be created:
  - AND
    - Match: Physiotherapy,GURU
    - OR
      - Match: Surgery,EXPERT
      - Match: Psychology,GURU 
    
  When applied to the resumes the
  - dr Bob  : (TRUE) & ((TRUE) | (FALSE)) -> TRUE
  - dr Phil : (TRUE) & ((FALSE) | (TRUE)) -> TRUE    
  So, both resumes match.

4 Hints & Tips

  - This assignment uses both Method Factory and Composite Patterns.
  - If you're of anonymous class a final may bridge your arguments.

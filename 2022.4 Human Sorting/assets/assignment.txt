## Artificial Intelligence and Sorting 

                A male engineer implemented a perfect AI algorithm to substitute his mother in law.
                - Every day he got different outputs from the AI software on what he did wrong!


Let's sort out all your holiday pictures with AI!
We probably all have a similar story: we went on a holiday and we have amassed a crazy amount of cool pictures...

Unfortunately these pictures are named photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg,... ,photo10.jpg,
photo11.jpg,..., photo100.jpg, ...., , photo200.jpg, etc. 

So when we sort by name, suddenly everything is sorted completely different then intended! 
like photo1.jpg, photo10.jpg, photo100.jpg, etc. This alphabetically order, is not our intended order.
Similar issues might occur in lists of product names with serial numbers. For instance a 
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is much newer than the GeForce GTX 260M.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was an algorithm that would sort names,
serial numbers and filenames in a human-sensible way? The good news is, this AI-algorithm certainly
exists and we are going to implement it right here in this Masters of Java assignment! 

A few hints on how to approach this:
- assume numbers are always written in the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system as we all know them (i.e. 0123456789). 
- we ignore decimal and thousands markers (you can consider '.' and ',' to be part of a string).
- chunk the strings into numerical parts (digits) and alphabetic parts (non-digits)
- compare those chunks in order :)

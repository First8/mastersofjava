1 Introduction

  Duke is now a boss and needs to distribute orders around in the duke factory.
  Each order needs to be processed in a particular order and on a specific timing.
  Of course Duke don't want's his colleagues to be doing nothing so all workers should
  be working as efficient as possible until all orders are fulfilled. 

2 Assignment

  Given a list of orders and working days return a list of orders per day. 
  The rules for the distribution should be:
  	- The primary distribution rule is that the orders with the highest value 
  	should be processed before the orders with the lowest value for each day.
  	- After applying the first rule above the workers should have an equal
  	workload for each day. When distributing make sure that the orders of higher
  	value for each worker are still processed first! 
  	
  	Exception to both rules is when the number of order cannot be exactly distributed  between the days.
  	In this case the first day will have the non distributed orders or the last day will contain
  	less (or no) orders.    

3 Example 

Example 1
Input:
  Days = 3
  order 1 = {value = 10, emp 1}
  order 2 = {value = 1, emp 1}
  order 3 = {value = 2, emp 2}
  order 4 = {value = 6, emp 2}
  order 5 = {value = 8, emp 1}

Output:
  day 1:
  	order 1 = {value = 10, emp 1}
	order 4 = {value = 6, emp 2}
	order 3 = {value = 2, emp 2}
	
  day 2:
    order 5 = {value = 8, emp 1}
  	
  day 3:
  	order 2 = {value = 1, emp 1}
  	
4 Hints & Tips

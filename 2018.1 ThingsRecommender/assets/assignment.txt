Dear employee,
 
As developer at BigMusicCompany you should already know that Big Data is, well, 
a big thing! We need to get on board with that. And since I, as CTO of 
BigMusicCompany, am a visionary, I have allocated half an hour of budget for you
to create a recommender for bands for people. But we'll call them Things so that 
we can pivot if we need to.
 
Shouldn't be too hard, I already envisioned the algorithm for you! Simply put, 
we have Ratings of people for bands, erh Things.
 
We first need to compare ratings of people. 
That's done by calculating the Euclidian distance between their shared ratings. 
You know, the square root of the sum of all the differences squared. If s(p1,b1)
 is the score given by person p1 for band b1 etc, the distance is:
sqrt( (s(p1, b1)-s(p2,b1))^2 + (s(p1, b2)-s(p2,b2))^2 + ...). 
 
Then, we need to find the closest person. That's the one with the lowest 
distance to the one we're recommending for.
 
And then, find the highest new rating of the closest person. Easy as pie!
  
(And yeah, I know, I know. Plenty of stuff to improve here. But think big! Think 
MVP!)

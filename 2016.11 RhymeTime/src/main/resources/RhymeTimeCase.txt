1. Introduction

  Sint Nicolas is coming! Soon all Dutch children will retrieve awesome presents and naturaly also funny poems. 
  But, because of the competition with Santa Clause in the Netherlands, he had to cut costs: all servants for writing poetry were fired. 
  Therefore Dutch parents are asked to provide Sint Nicolas with plenty of software to write poems with.
  In this project, rhyming can be computed via the component Soundex, which needs to be enabled. 

2. Assigment

  Implement the method 'toSoundex' in RhymeAssistant. This method should be able to transform lines into a rhyme scheme.
  Logically, the output should be [a,b,a,b], when input is 4 lines long and its individual ends are these 4 words: java, deer, lava, engineer.    
   
3. Examples

  Both rhymes below should give an output of [a,a,b,b] 

  My day ain't complete sans a cuppa java
  And it must be as blisterin' hot as flowin' lava
  The rich succulent flavor I crave in the morning
  The aromatic scent that keeps me adoring

  Java you are the breath that keeps me whole
  The warmth that entices my soul
  So I cherish every drop
  My love could never stop

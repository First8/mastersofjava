## The case of disappearing tasks

Caroline is helping her aunt and uncle on the farm. 
Among other tasks, each day she has to check some cows 
who are 
for example pregnant or ill, to see how they are doing. 
To keep track of which task she has to do and in what 
order, she started building a tool to help out. These 
days, a farmer has to be able to do a lot of things, 
including programming.

Somehow however, tasks are getting lost. She is sure that
she has correctly set the state for each cow, but tasks 
that should have been generated don't pop up. After much 
trial and error, she finally managed to at least create a
unit test that consistently fails (see `testMoreTasks` in
`TestPrioritizedTaskList`). So, the hard part of any 
bughunt is done: it is reproducable. 

Now, can you fix it?

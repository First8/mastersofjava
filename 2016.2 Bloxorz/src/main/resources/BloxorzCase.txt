1. Introduction

  Java heroes love to compete in games with eachother after work hours. Recently, the Duke has found a new game: Bloxorz.    
  Bloxorz is a game where the player must navigate a rectangular block into an opening (hole) somewhere on the board. 
  The block can be moved by rolling. If you fall off the board, then your game is over. 

2. Assignment

  You should implement the 'calculate' method in the GameEngineImpl class.  

3. Examples
  
  Below(B=Begin,O=Destination,X=Road) 

  * ShortestPath(BO)  = 1 step
  * ShortestPath(BXXO)= 3 steps
                (BXXX)
  * ShortestPath{X  X}= 4 steps
                (XXOX) 
  * See the Bloxorz class for a larger example. 
 
4. Hints
  * Don't forget to keep track of the previously made moves!
  * Use the 'isValid' and 'isFinished' methods in the Board class to determine the state of the game.

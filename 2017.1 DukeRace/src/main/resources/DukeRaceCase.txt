#Introduction
Being an expert, people have often asked your for the quickest way to go to the finish the Formula 1 race. 
As an engineer you might answer: drive against the first tree on the track, but people sometimes do not like the truth that engineers tell them.  
So that is why you decided the make a program on this matter, so you can give the exact answer. 

We'd like to be able to predict the results of a race, based on: 
- the length of the track, 
- the acceleration of the racers accel, and 
- the top speed of the racers spd. 

Assume that the racers will accelerate constantly until they reach their respective top speeds, and then they will remain at that top speed until the end of the race.

Your goal is to return an array res, where res[i] is the place the ith racer will take in this competition (0-based). In the case of a tie, the racer with the lower pole position (index) wins.

##Example

For track = 10, accel = [2, 2] and spd = [2, 4], the output should be
	racers(track, accel, spd) = [1, 0].
There are two racers, Racer #0, and Racer #1. Both Racer #0 and Racer #1 can accelerate at 2m/s². Racer #0 has a top speed of 2m/s, and Racer #1 has a top speed of 4m/s.
They race down a 10m track. Racer #1 will win this race, and Racer #0 will take second place. So, since the answer should be 0-based, we return [1, 0].

For track = 10, accel = [2, 2] and spd = [2, 2], the output should be
	racers(track, accel, spd) = [0, 1].
There are two identical racers, Racer #0, and Racer #1. Both Racer #0 and Racer #1 can accelerate at 2m/s². Both Racer #0 and Racer #1 have a top speed of 2m/s.
They race down a 10m track. The race would be a tie, so we give the win to Racer #0, who had the better pole position, while Racer #1 takes second place. So the answer is [0, 1].

##Input/Output

track - The length of the track in meters.
	Guaranteed constraints:
	1 ≤ track ≤ 5 · 106.

accel - An array of integers representing the acceleration of the racers in meters per second squared (m/s²).
	Guaranteed constraints:
	1 ≤ accel.length ≤ 20,
	1 ≤ accel[i] ≤ 20.

spd - An array of integers representing the top speed of the racers in meters per second (m/s).
	Guaranteed constraints:
	spd.length = accel.length,
	1 ≤ accel[i] ≤ 350.

An array of integers res, where res[i] is the place the ith racer will take in the competition.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
 different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
once.[1] For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into "naga ram". The
original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram. Any word or
phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram.
Someone who creates anagrams may be called an "anagrammatist",[2] and the
goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that
reflect or comment on their subject.

Since this is Masters of Java, and "Master" is an anagram of "stream", we'll
build an anagram checker with... streams! Since you only have half an hour, 
we've already built the stream for you. Simply complete the supplier, 
accumulator and combiner in the Helper class, and you're done!

Guck Lood!

For this Checker, an anagram is defined with the following constraints:

* Whitespaces are ignored. Given a subject 'adultery' the possibility 
'true lady' returns true. 

* Casing is ignored. Given a subject 'Adultery' the possibility 'true lady' 
returns true. 

* The count for a single character must match exactly. Given a subject 
'absolves', the possibility 'absolve' returns false 

* All characters must be used exactly once. Given a subject 'aardvarks' the 
possibility 'radars' returns false.

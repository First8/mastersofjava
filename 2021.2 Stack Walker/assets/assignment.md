# The Rise Of Stackwalker.

### INTRODUCTION
- Q: Why did Starwars Episodes 4, 5, and 6 come out before 1, 2, and 3??
- A: Because in charge of directing, Yoda was!

In a galaxy far, far away a saga restarts. The Dark Force has encrypted the access to a battleship with an unknown mystery code.
This secret is hidden in Junit tests. The voice from the evil Dark Force Emperor laughs sadistically: you must pass the unit-tests! 

### ASSIGNMENT
The secret code can only be revealed with the Java 9 Stackwalker API.

The algorithm for the secret code has these rules:
- create a collection of stack-elements using the Stackwalker API
- take the first 'n' elements with package name “org.junit”
- then only use the linenumber if it belongs to a methodname containing “run”
- make a summation of these linenumbers
- when n=15, that is the secret code!

### HINTS
- Look at the main unit-test. Complete the missing code in RisingStackWalker!
- After you know the sum of the 15-th, press the submit and Duke's battleship will save our Galaxy once again!

Software development is serious business. We as Developers are lined up to solve
the worlds biggest problems, ranging from space exploration to medical research.

Today we are going to solve one such issue. You probably all know that nagging 
feeling when you approach your birthday, especially if it is a Big One, such as
your 20th, 30rd or 40th birthday. Wouldn't it be nice to share the pain a bit 
with your friends or family? Let's celebrate a joint 100th birthday!

Your task is to determine the date when a group of people (your Family) has 
reached a combined given age. More specifically, the first date where all the 
ages of persons added up are at least the target age.

Oh, and please be a bit efficient in solving it; our unit tests may time out 
otherwise causing a failure...

Enjoy and potentially win a nobel price solving this age old problem!

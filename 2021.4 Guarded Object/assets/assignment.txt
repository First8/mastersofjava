Complying with the ISO 27001 Audit

Security is always important when building software. Often, companies want to 
prove objectively that they take security seriously. That's where ISO 27001 
comes into place. If your company is certified, the auditor agrees that, each 
year, your company is improving on the security side. (It says a bit less about 
the base line security though...)

Your assignment today is about solving a Minor Non-Conformity. Apparently, 
documents are properly labeled (classified) for being public or non-public. But, 
there is no control on whether that label is actually inspected, used and 
complied to. More specifically, NON_PUBLIC documents should not be accessible by 
the REST API. Of course, our internal audit tool must be able to access 
PUBLIC and NON_PUBLIC documents.

Luckily, Java has a nifty API for that since the early days. Much overlooked but
still quite convenient, GuardedObjects can help in adding yet another layer of
security. 

So, all the framework stuff is already done. You only need to implement the ISO 
27001 control. How? That is up to you. 

In the SDK there are already many Guards implemented but a quick search on 
ISO 27001 did not return any. So, maybe reuse one of the existing ones? Or simply
implement it on your own?

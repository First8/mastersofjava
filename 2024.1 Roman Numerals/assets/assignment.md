## Roman numerals

With the upcoming banning of Tiktok the risk exists that no one will think about the Roman Empire ever again. (1)

We are in danger of losing the knowledge of interpreting the beautiful and elegant numerical system of the Roman Empire. 
Therefore, you are assigned to encode this knowledge into the RomanInterpreter and safeguard this knowledge forever into the cloud.
We already have made the RomanInterpreter class for you.
Your assignment today is to implement the method that converts a roman numeral to the arabic version that we all know so well.

Thank you for helping us save this essential knowledge.

These are all the roman numerals:

| Roman | Value |
|-------|-------|
| I     | 1     |
| V     | 5     |
| X     | 10    |
| L     | 50    |
| C     | 100   |
| D     | 500   |
| M     | 1000  |

The rules of the roman numerical system:

- The value of the symbol is added to itself, as many times as it is repeated. (Eg. II – 2, XX – 20 and XXX – 30).
- A symbol can be repeated only for three times, for example XXX = 30, CC = 200, etc.
- Symbols V, L, and D are never repeated.
- When a symbol of smaller value appears after a symbol of greater value, its values will be added. For Example-  VI = V + I = 5 + 1 = 6.
- When a symbol of a smaller value appears before a greater value symbol, it will be subtracted. For Example-  IX = X – I = 10 – 1 = 9.
- The symbols V, L, and D are never subtracted, as they are not written before a greater value symbol. 
- The symbol I can be subtracted from V and X only and symbol X can be subtracted from symbols L and C only.

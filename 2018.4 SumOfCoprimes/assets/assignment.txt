In number theory, two integers A and B are said to be coprime if the only 
positive integer that evenly divides both of them is 1,
so the integers have no common denominator greater than 1 and completely build 
different. So, 4 and 9 are coprime, since 4 divides by 1,2 and 4; 9 divides by 
1, 3 and 9. And they only share 1 as a divider. So they are coprime.

For a given number m, find all the coprimes lower than m. Then sum them up 
modulo 201201 and output that number. 

To make things easy (easier?), you can assume that 'm' is limited between 1 and 
70201. We've already provided a 'Primes' helper class for you if you fancy doing
stuff with primes.

Some examples:

execute(5) = 9 (4+3+2, not 1)
execute(6) = 5 (only 5)
execute(7) = 20 (6+5+4+3+2, not 1)
execute(8) = 15 (3+5+7)

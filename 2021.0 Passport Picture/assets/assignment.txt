For a new pet project, Kevin Mitnick has developed a streaming cloud solution 
that he plans to sell as a SaaS. This software-as-a-service project allows you 
to upload your passport photo and the service automatically generates your own 
passport and drivers license, depending on the type of a service you subscribed 
to.

All the nuts and bolts are there, but one of the most important parts, scaling 
of the picture is still missing. Therefore, the service generates IDs with 
invalid picture sizes. Conform the regulations of the US government, the 
pictures need to be scaled "smooth"ly on a white background color.

Can you, our Java Master, help him out with this ancient part of the Java API?

The tests output images as ascii art. If it looks a bit weird, maybe zoom in or 
out so that it displays better.

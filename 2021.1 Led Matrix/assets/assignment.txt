The Christmas days are upcoming and you decide that this is the perfect opportunity to build a project with LEDs.
Since ordinary LEDs are not cool enough for you as a Java developer, you choose to use programmable LEDs that can
be individually turned ON an OFF. You decide to build a LED Matrix, for which you are using one long LEDstrip that you
cut into even smaller pieces to build the matrix. To simplify the physical wiring in the Matrix, you decide to attach
the pieces in a way such that the data line in the LEDstrip runs in a horizontal zigzag pattern like the example
displayed below.

0  >  1  >  2  >  3
                  |
7  <  6  <  5  <  4
|
8  >  9  >  10 > 11
                  |
15 <  14 <  13 < 12

The LEDs on the LEDstrip can be individually turned ON or OFF via sending a signal to each specific LED. The data line
that starts at the first LED and runs all the way to the last LED in the matrix.

Before you can display pictures on the LED Matrix, you have write the software that translates the zigzag pattern to
the correct output for the boolean[] LEDstring, when given a boolean[][] image.

First implement the xyToled(int x, int y) method that returns the right index of the LEDstrip when given a specific
(x,y) coordinate for that matrix.

Than implement the getStrip(boolean[][] image) method that returns a boolean[] LEDstrip, when given a boolean[][] image.

Can you make this work and display the Christmas Tree??

## Requirement hell

Agile working seems to be the solution to all problems these days. While we as devs
no longer have to do proper planning and we can get away with _guestimating_ these
nonsense things called _story points_, it also means that our customers don't have 
to have a proper plan to start with. We've all had a product-owner-from-hell once. So, this assignment should be
familiar for those of you with agile experience. Welcome to the Requirement Hell!

We are going to build the next number one app in the App Store or Play Store: an app that will generate _THE_ best baby
names list there is. Not sure yet how that will work out, but the first requirement will be that, if we have that
awesome list of names, it has to be sorted in alphabetical order.

Once you've implemented that, the tests will point to the next requirement.

PS. For technical reasons: Please do not use static fields. Those can result in unexpected behaviour.

## Set
This is a set:

```
┌────────┐┌────────┐┌────────┐
|1       ||2       ||3       | = all different
|DIAMOND ||OVAL    ||SQUIGGLE| = all different
|OPEN    ||OPEN    ||OPEN    | = all the same
|RED     ||RED     ||RED     | = all the same
└────────┘└────────┘└────────┘
```

This is not a set:

```
┌────────┐┌────────┐┌────────┐
|3       ||2       ||1       |
|OVAL    ||OVAL    ||SQUIGGLE| = Not all different or the same!
|SOLID   ||STRIPED ||OPEN    |
|GREEN   ||GREEN   ||GREEN   |
└────────┘└────────┘└────────┘
```
Got it? Good luck.


Need more info? Here is how wikipedia explains it: 

In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a "set". For each one 
of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must 
display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each 
feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the 
remaining card showing a different version.

For example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squiggles, and 1 solid purple oval form a set, 
because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the
shapes among the three cards are all different.

For any set, the number of features that are constant (the same on all three cards) and the number 
of features that differ (different on all three cards) may break down as: all 4 features differing; 
or 1 feature being constant and 3 differing; or 2 constant and 2 differing; or 3 constant and 1 differing. 
(All 4 features being constant would imply that the three cards in the set are identical, 
which is impossible since no cards in the Set deck are identical.)

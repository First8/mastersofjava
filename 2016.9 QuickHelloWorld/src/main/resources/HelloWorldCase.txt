1. Introduction

  ESA and the NLJUG will soon launch a deep space probe. If it will encounter an alien lifeform the probe must
  send a personalised greeting to the alien. Everybody knows that aliens like to be treated humanly.
  This advanced piece of technology will be coded by nobody else but you, our star(ting) programmer. 

2. Assigment

  Implement the method 'sayIt(String name)' in such a way that it will return a formal earthly greeting.
  <EDIT: grammar?> The result must be 'Hello' followed by the name. If the name is not given, simply state 'Hello' without the
  name.

3. Example
  Based on a given name, the output should be:

  Given 'NLJUG' -> 'Hello NLJUG'
        'Programming fun' -> 'Hello Programming fun'
        '' or null -> 'Hello'

4. Hints

  * The quotes in the assignment and testcases are just for readability.
  * You can concatenate strings
  * If the string is null return "Hello"

Do you like solving crossword puzzles? We do! And we've solved a few already for
you! Can you check if they are valid solutions?

You are given a list of Clue's. Those contain:
- the clue
- the word that's the solution to the clue
- its coordinates 
- whether or not it is horizontal (or vertical).

So a clue could be: 'A programming language' with an answer 'Java'. And it is 
placed at coordinates (0,0, horizontal). Another clue may be 'to make an 
assumption' with as answer 'assert', placed at (0,1,vertically). These form a 
valid crossword puzzle since there are no two different characters in a cell:


[java]
[ s  ]
[ s  ]
[ e  ]
[ r  ]
[ t  ]
 

Note: to keep things simple in this first assignment, we are not interested in 
adjacency checks. So, in this exercise, the following solutions are considered 
valid:

"Valid" puzzles:

[javaassert]
 - note that we do not validate if there is an empty cell between the words

[java  ]
[assert]
- note that we do not validate if [ja], [as], [vs], [ae] are actually words

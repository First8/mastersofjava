(from Wikipedia:) The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry 
structures located in Egypt. Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs 
and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.

The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis.
The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of 
Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures 
ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. 
It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.


All that has not really something to do with this assignment. We're going to
look at number pyramids:

  7
 6 5
3 8 1

You can navigate this pyramid by starting at the top (7) and then choosing to go
left or right (6 or 5). If you choose 6, then you can choose again to go left or
right (3 or 8). If you add up all these numbers (7 + 6 + 8) you get 21, and that 
is the maximum number you can get in this pyramid.

You assignment is: given a pyramid, return the maximum number for that pyramid.

Your input will by a 2-dimensional array containing the pyramid. For the example
above, pyramid[0][0] = 7 and pyramid[2][1] = 8.

There's just one catch: make sure your solution is fast. You need to be able to 
solve BIG pyramids fast as well. For that, think a bit eh down-side-up?
